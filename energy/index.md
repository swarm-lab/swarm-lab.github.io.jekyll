### Project overview

Regulation mechanisms are crucial for keeping systems working properly. For 
example, human body temperature is controlled by neurons and hormones that 
manage heat production and loss to prevent dangerous conditions. Typically, 
regulation involves circuits connecting sensors to actions, like a thermostat in 
an air conditioner. However, systems made up of many mobile units, like ant 
colonies or robot fleets, don’t have these stable connections.

This research unites biologists, theorists, and engineers to achieve two main 
goals: understanding how flexible systems like ant colonies regulate themselves, 
and developing principles to create artificial systems that can self-regulate in 
changing environments. The project also offers educational opportunities for 
students from K-12 to Ph.D. levels to learn about self-regulation in social 
systems and its applications in technology.

The project has three main components:

1. **Ant Experiments:** we will study ants in the lab to see how they manage 
their activities when faced with different levels of energy demand and 
availability. We’ll use computer vision to observe the ants’ behaviors and 
respirometry to measure their energy levels.

2. **Theoretical Framework:** Using the results from the ant experiments, we 
will create a theoretical model to understand and design energy regulation in 
groups of self-organizing units. This model will help identify the behaviors 
that lead to successful or failed collective energy management.

3. **Robotic Swarms:** finally, we will develop and test ways to manage energy 
in groups of robots. We'll run simulations and real-world experiments to see how 
well these robots can balance energy supply and demand in changing environments.

Overall, this project aims to understand how biological groups maintain 
stability and function, even when their energy needs and resources change, and 
to apply our findings to artificial systems, liks swarm of autonomous robots and
fleets of self-driving vehicles.
