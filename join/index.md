title: Join the Swarm Lab

#### Postdoctoral researchers

[//]: # There is currently no postdoctoral position available at the Swarm Lab

---

**We currently have a postdoctoral position available on a DARPA-funded research project aimed at testing and validating modeling methods for detecting the onset of migrations and predicting their final destinations using ant colonies as a model system. More info [here](/blog/2019/06/06/postdoc-position/).**

Postdoctoral positions are rare because grants large enough to support a postdoctoral researcher are also rare. If you want to join the Swarm Lab as a postdoctoral researcher, your best option is to apply for postdoctoral fellowships that are granted by public and private foundations (NSF, Fulbrigth, Fyssen, etc.). A fairly exhaustive list of postdoctoral funding opportunities was compiled by [Marissa Baskett](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/baskett) who made it available  [here](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/baskett/links/academia.html#Postdoc).

The members of the Swarm Lab will very happy to help you find and apply for postdoctoral fellowships for which you are eligible. If you are interested, please do not hesitate to contact us at [jobs@theswarmlab.com](mailto:jobs@theswarmlab.com) or using our [contact form](/#contact).

#### Graduate students

Our lab is multidisciplinary and we welcome applications for graduate students with a background in biology, physics, mathematics, computer science, social science, etc. Please feel free to send us an email with your CV at [jobs@theswarmlab.com](mailto:jobs@theswarmlab.com). Make sure to include a paragraph or two explaining why you are interested in joining our lab. Depending on your background, we will direct you to the most appropriate graduate program at NJIT and/or Rutgers-Newark (the SwarmLab is part of the NJIT/Rutgers-Newark Federated Department of Biology). We will also help you during the application process. Most graduate programs offer direct financial support to their students via teaching assistantships. The members of the SwarmLab will also work with you to apply for external fellowships in order to supplement or replace the funding provided by the graduate school. If you have any question about joining the SwarmLab as a graduate student, please do not hesitate to contact us at [jobs@theswarmlab.com](mailto:jobs@theswarmlab.com) or using our [contact form](/#contact).

#### Undergraduate and Master students (NJIT and Rutgers University)

The SwarmLab has a very active and diverse research program. All scientific disciplines are welcome and we will consider all applications from undergraduate and master students from NJIT and Rutgers University (see Visitors section below for other universities). Undergraduate students are eligible to register for one of the “Research and Independent Study” biology courses at NJIT or Rutgers Newark in order to get credits while conducting research projects in our lab. When possible, the members of the SwarmLab will also help you find and apply for fellowships to support you while you work with us. If you are interested in joining us or have any question about joining the SwarmLab as an undergraduate, please do not hesitate to contact us at [jobs@theswarmlab.com](mailto:jobs@theswarmlab.com) or using our [contact form](/#contact).

#### Visitors (all levels)

We welcome visitors at all levels to collaborate on research projects or do internships with us. Funding to support visitors is scarce but we will happily help you apply for fellowships (if available) in order to support your stay with us. We will also help you find affordable transportation to and housing options in or around Newark. Since every visitor case is unique, please contact us at [jobs@theswarmlab.com](mailto:jobs@theswarmlab.com) or using our [contact form](/#contact), and we will discuss your project and do everything possible to make it happen.
