title: Group meetings

---

The SwarmLab holds joint group meetings with the [Russell Lab](https://sites.google.com/a/njit.edu/russell-lab/) at NJIT. The two groups share several interests, including the use of remote sensing technology and geographic information systems (GIS) for studying animal movement, in relationship with the structure of the environment and with the social context in which the animals behave.
