The SwarmLab at the [New Jersey Institute of Technology](http://www.njit.edu/) (NJIT) is seeking a postdoctoral researcher with expertise in the modeling and analysis of collective behaviors and complex systems. The successful candidate will join a [DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/)-funded research project aimed at testing and validating modeling methods for detecting the onset of migrations and predicting their final destinations using ant colonies as a model system.

The position is starting as early as August 1st, 2019, and is expected to be filled no later than October 1, 2019. The position is initially for 2 years, with the possibility of being extended for 1 additional year following an evaluation of the project's progress by the funding agency.

Potential candidates are strongly encouraged to contact Simon Garnier ([garnier@njit.edu](mailto:garnier@njit.edu)) to discuss the details of the project and learn more about the position. Applications will be reviewed as they are received. The application period will be open until filled.

### Profile

We are seeking candidates with the following profile:
+ A strong interest in conducting collaborative research on the topic described above. Previous research experience on this topic is not required.
+ Experience with and/or strong desire for working in an interdisciplinary environment.
+ Knowledge and experience in the modeling and analysis of collective behaviors and/or complex systems.
+ Knowledge and experience in using modern statistical tools (e.g. GLMMs), and/or machine learning techniques (e.g. ANNs, classifiers), and/or agent-based modeling methods, and/or mathematical modeling approaches.
+ Knowledge and experience in programming (typical languages used in the lab are R, C++, Python, Julia, Matlab, Mathematica).
+ Knowledge and experience in working with ant colonies or other social species are not required, but an interest in participating in the experimental portion of the project is preferred.

### Essential functions

The successful candidate will be expected to fulfill the following essential functions:
+ Lead with the PI the analysis and modeling portion of the project, in collaboration with other lab members who will focus on the experimental portion.
+ Contribute to or lead lab publications, conference submissions, as well as grant proposals.
+ Act as a mentor to diverse and ambitious students in the lab, as well as collaborate effectively with colleagues and support staff.
+ Through mentorship and strategic planning with the PI, develop additional skills and experience valuable to long-term career goals.

While the functions of the successful candidate will be primarily focused on the goals of the DARPA-funded research project, there will be opportunities to develop independent projects as well as participate in other ongoing lab initiatives.

### Mentoring

The successful candidate will receive direct guidance in mentoring students, the development of new scientific skillsets, and career planning. In addition, funding is available to attend development workshops and conferences. Part of the project planning will include a roadmap for generating products that correspond with the candidate’s long-term career goals.

### The lab

The SwarmLab is an interdisciplinary research lab that studies the mechanisms underlying the coordination of large animal groups, such as ant colonies or human crowds, and their applications to complex problems such the organization of pedestrian traffic or the control of robotic swarms. We study how information is exchanged and transformed during interactions between the members of a group, and how this can lead to the emergence of successful or catastrophic group behaviors.

### The department

The lab is part of the Federated Department of Biological Sciences, which spans Rutgers University–Newark and NJIT. Located in NJIT’s urban campus in Newark, the lab is part of a vibrant and active research department, with strengths in ecology, systematics, animal behavior, functional morphology, as well as cellular and neurobiology. In addition, NJIT has strong research groups in engineering, computer science, and mathematics, and is situated in the very academically-dense New York City metro area, with universities like Columbia, NYU, CUNY, Rockefeller, Princeton, and more within an hour range.
