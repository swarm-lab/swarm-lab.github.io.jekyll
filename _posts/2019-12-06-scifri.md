Our very own slime mold (*Physarum polycephalum*) was the first organism featured
on the new [Science Friday](https://www.sciencefriday.com/) segment "Charismatic
Creature". Simon was live with [Elah Feder](https://www.sciencefriday.com/person/elah-feder/)
and  [Ira Flatow](https://www.sciencefriday.com/person/ira-flatow/) to discuss
the weird intelligence of our favorite blob.
