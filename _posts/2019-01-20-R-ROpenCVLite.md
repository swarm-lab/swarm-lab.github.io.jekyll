    <b>Description:</b> <code>ROpenCVLite</code> is a utility package that installs <a href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a> within R for use by other packages. This package is not a wrapper around OpenCV (it does not provide access to OpenCV functions in R), not is it a computer vision package for R. All it does is compiling and installing OpenCV within your R installation so that other packages can easily find it and compile against it.
