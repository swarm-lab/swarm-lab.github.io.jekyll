SINNERS is a more or less annual gathering of scientists working on social insects
and located more or less in the north eastern part of the US. Since 2012, it has
brought together a diverse, creative group of students and scientists to share
the remarkable advances of social insect science. Presentations are all centered
on social insect systems, but cover a wide range of topics, including: behavioral
ecology, microbiomes and symbiosis, pollination, agricultural applications,
neuroanatomy, and much more. This conference builds lasting research relationships
between scientists at all stages of their careers. In addition, it provides an
excellent opportunity for students and postdocs to receive feedback on their
work from knowledgeable senior level researchers and peers.
