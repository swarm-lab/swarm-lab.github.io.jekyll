description: 
    <b>Description:</b> <code>videoplayR</code> makes it possible to import video as R matrices for computer vision 
    applications. It is still in a very early stage of development and requires the installation of the 
    <a href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV library</a> before it can be installed and can work properly. 
    <code>videoplayR</code> has been compiled and tested on Mac OS X only (10.9 and 10.10) and it is not guaranteed that 
    it will install or work properly on Windows and Linux computers at the moment.
