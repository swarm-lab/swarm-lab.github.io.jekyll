The SwarmLab was featured today in a New York Times article by [Joshua Sokol](https://joshuasokol.com/) discussing the science fiction myth that disabling the "queen" of a swarm will immediately lead its collapse (it doesn't!). You can read it all in ["Striking Down the Queen Wonâ€™t Save You From the Swarm"](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/science/hives-queens-science-fiction.html).
