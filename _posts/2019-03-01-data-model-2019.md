The SwarmLab is pleased to announce the 4th Collaborative Workshop on Modeling Collective Behavior, funded by the NSF OAC Public Access Initiative [grant #1838955](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1838955). The goal of this workshop is to provide researchers coming from mathematics, physics, engineering and biology with experience in working collaboratively to model and analyze data produced by research in collective behavior. This year we are also including an interdisciplinary art/science project (see Project 4 below) that will use virtual reality to explore and interact with data and models of collective behaviors.

All information about the workshop, including application instructions and deadline, can be found [here](/meetings/data_model_2019/).
