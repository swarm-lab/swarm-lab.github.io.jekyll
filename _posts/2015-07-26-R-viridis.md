    <b>Description:</b> <code>viridis</code> is a color palette designed in such a way that it will analytically be 
    perfectly perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when converted to black-and-white. It is also designed 
    to be perceived by readers with the most common form of color blindness. 
    <br><br>
    <code>viridis</code> was originally created by <a href="https://github.com/stefanv">Stéfan van der Walt</a> and 
    <a href="https://github.com/njsmith">Nathaniel Smith</a> to become the new default palette of the popular 
    <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">Python Matplotlib library</a>. This R package makes <code>viridis</code> available 
    to R users as well.
