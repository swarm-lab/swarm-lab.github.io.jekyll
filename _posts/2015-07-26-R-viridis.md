    <b>Description:</b> <code>viridis</code> is a color palette designed in such a way that it will analytically be perfectly perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when converted to black-and-white. It is also designed to be perceived by readers with the most common form of color blindness.
    <br><br>
    <code>viridis</code> was originally created by <a href="https://github.com/stefanv">St√©fan van der Walt</a> and <a href="https://github.com/njsmith">Nathaniel Smith</a> to become the new default palette of the popular <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">Python Matplotlib library</a>. This R package makes <code>viridis</code> available to R users as well.
    <br><br>
